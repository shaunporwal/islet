Islet contains personal R functions. I'm also using this to learn how to create R packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of islet from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shaunporwal/islet")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r load library}
library(islet)
```

```{r example 1}

# Simple Example, Default '&' Border
islet::make_banner(str_to_banner = 'analyze column from dataframe')
# Output Saved to Clipboard, Can Cmd+v or Ctrl+v to directly paste banner

```

```{r example 2}

# New Banner Border Example
islet::make_banner(str_to_banner = 'analyze column from dataframe',
                   banner_chr = '+')

```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
